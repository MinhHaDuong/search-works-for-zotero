# tickets/

Local file-based tickets store for the project.

Agents should ensure the `erg` binary helper is available to manipulate tickets.
To get it: check `tickets/erg` (committed bootstrap binary, Linux x86-64 only).

As a fallback, agents can read/write directly using the example template:

Title: Add retry logic for failed API requests

## Context
The HTTP client silently drops requests when the upstream returns 503.
We need exponential backoff with jitter, capped at 3 retries.

## Exit criteria
- [ ] `client.Fetch()` retries up to 3 times on 5xx
- [ ] Backoff is 1s, 2s, 4s + random jitter less than 500ms
- [ ] Unit test covers retry exhaustion path
- [ ] `make check` passes
```

Rules agents must know:
- No `Status:` header in %erg 0.1 (use `erg migrate` for legacy files)
- Closed/not-closed is inferred from path conventions or a non-empty `Closed:` header
- `Label:` is optional and repeatable; accepted values are defined in `tickets/.ergrc` (defaults: `needs-human`, `deferred`)
- Log entries are append-only: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ author verb detail`
- Ticket IDs are atomic 4-digit numbers -- never suffix them (`0134a`, `0134b`). To split a ticket, create new numbered tickets with descriptive slugs that cross-reference the parent in their body; on ID collision, renumber to the next free ID (`git mv` + fix cross-references).
- Artifacts a ticket consumes or produces (reports, data, generated files, scripts) live in their natural location in the project tree and are referenced from the body by path, not embedded wholesale, and not kept as a filename-twinned `0002-slug.md` sidecar the tooling cannot track.

On GitHub, `tickets/erg-github` (a separate committed helper, not an `erg` subcommand) adds a `verify` check that fails a PR referencing a still-open ticket -- so close the ticket in the same PR (`erg close`).

In doubt, run `erg spec` (file format) or `erg --help --all` / `erg COMMAND --help` for command documentation.
